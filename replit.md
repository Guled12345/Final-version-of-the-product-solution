# Learning Risk Assessment App

## Overview

This is a Streamlit-based web application designed to predict learning difficulties in students using machine learning. The app provides a comprehensive platform for teachers and parents to assess student learning risks, access educational resources, and track student progress. Originally conceived as a PyQt5 desktop application, it has been implemented as a web-based solution for better accessibility and deployment.

## Architecture Decisions

### Technology Choices

**Problem**: Need for accessible learning difficulty assessment tool
**Solution**: Streamlit web application over desktop PyQt5 application
**Rationale**: Better accessibility, easier deployment, cross-platform compatibility
**Trade-offs**: Requires internet connection vs. pure offline capability

**Problem**: Data persistence without database complexity
**Solution**: JSON file-based storage system
**Rationale**: Simplicity, portability, no database setup required
**Trade-offs**: Limited scalability vs. ease of deployment and maintenance

**Problem**: Machine learning model for risk prediction
**Solution**: RandomForest classifier with synthetic training data
**Rationale**: Robust performance, interpretable results, handles mixed data types
**Trade-offs**: Requires representative training data vs. immediate deployment capability

### Design Patterns

**Modular Architecture**: Separate utility modules for model and data operations enable code reusability and testing
**Multi-page Structure**: Streamlit's page system provides clear separation of concerns and user workflows
**Progressive Enhancement**: Basic functionality works without advanced features, supporting incremental development
